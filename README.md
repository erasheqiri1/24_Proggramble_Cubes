## Programmable Cubes – Genetic Algorithm Solution

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Programmable Cubes optimization problem from the ESA Space Optimization Competition (SpOC3).
The problem involves rearranging modular cubes into target configurations under strict physical constraints, resulting in a large combinatorial search space. Due to its complexity, heuristic optimization methods are required.

### Problem Description

Three official ESA instances are considered:
* ISS – low complexity
* JWST – medium complexity
* Enterprise – high complexity

Each instance differs in search space size and constraint density.
